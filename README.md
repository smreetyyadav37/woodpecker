## AI based Natural Disaster Prediction & Response System

### Overview

The AI-Based Disaster Prediction and Response System aims to enhance disaster preparedness and response by predicting natural disasters, such as earthquakes, using historical and real-time data. This system leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions and actionable insights to emergency responders and affected communities.

### Project Components

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building and Training
- Model Evaluation
- User Interface (UI) 
- Documentation

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
#### Description
Data is collected from the USGS and preprocessed to prepare it for machine learning models. The preprocessing steps include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.

#### Files
- `preprocess_earthquake_data.py` - Script for preprocessing the earthquake data.
- Output: processed_earthquake_data.csv
#### Instructions
- Place your raw earthquake data CSV file in the project directory.
- Run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocess_earthquake_data.py
```
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Description
- EDA is performed to understand the data better through visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

#### Files
- `eda_earthquake_data.py` - Script for performing EDA.
- Outputs: Visualizations saved in the results folder.
#### Instructions
- Ensure that processed_earthquake_data.csv is available in the project directory.
- Run the EDA script:

```bash
python eda_earthquake_data.py
```
3. Model Building and Training
#### Description
- An LSTM-based neural network model is built for predicting earthquakes based on historical data.

#### Files
- `model_building.py` - Script for building the model.
- Output: Model architecture saved as results/model_architecture.h5
Note: Model training script is assumed but not provided in detail.

#### Instructions
- Run the model building script:
```bash
python model_building.py
```
-Train the Model: Use the appropriate training script to train the model and save it as `results/trained_model.h5`.

4. Model Evaluation
#### Description
- The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²). Residual analysis is performed to assess model performance.

#### Files
- `model_evaluation.py` - Script for evaluating the model.
- Outputs: Evaluation metrics and plots saved in the results folder.

#### Instructions
- Ensure that processed_earthquake_data.csv and results/trained_model.h5 are available.
- Run the evaluation script:
```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```
5. User Interface (UI)
#### Description
- Plans are underway to develop an interactive UI for visualizations and alerts. This component will allow users to interact with the system and view real-time predictions and responses.

#### Files
- Placeholder for future implementation.
#### Instructions
- Details and implementation will be provided in future updates.

6. Documentation

#### Description
- Comprehensive documentation of the project, including code, methodologies, and results.

#### Files
- `README.md` - Overview and instructions.
